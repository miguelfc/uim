Unified Infrastructure Manager Utilities

This repository contains several utilities that I have built in order to provide missing UIM features, extend existing ones and make our life easier while deploying UIM solutions.

Current tools available:
- **UIM Alerts Cleaner**: A simple Java application that could be called from SOI, passing the [Source Alert ID] field as an argument, that executes an ACK operation to an alarm in UIM.
